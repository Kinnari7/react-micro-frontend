## Why we need to use Micro-frontends ?
  * Micro-frontends provide multiple features or modules for web apps owned by independent teams to making them more user-friendly and less bulky.

## Setting up a project
  * Move into your projects directory: cd ~/YOUR_PROJECTS_DIRECTORY.

## Working on the project
  * Move into the project directory: cd ~/YOUR_PROJECTS_DIRECTORY/YOUR_PROJECT_NAME 

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run for both projects:
### `npm install`

Also, Install the below dependency.
### `npm install -g webpack webpack-cli`

Run both projects through the webpack:
### `webpack serve`

That's it !!!
